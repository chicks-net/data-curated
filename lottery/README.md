Kudos to the great State of New York for their
[awesome data sources](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=winning)
for the winning lottery numbers.

## California Lottery Jackpot Checker

The `jackpot-checker.go` program fetches current Mega Millions and Powerball
jackpot amounts from the California State Lottery API and stores them in a
SQLite database.

See [JACKPOT-README.md](JACKPOT-README.md) for details on usage.
