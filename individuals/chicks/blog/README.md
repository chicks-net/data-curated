# Blog Post Counter & Graph Generator

Go programs that count and visualize blog posts per month from
[chicks.net/posts](https://www.chicks.net/posts/).

## Usage

### Using just (recommended)

From the repository root:

```bash
# Count blog posts and generate CSV
just count-posts

# Generate graph from CSV (all months)
just graph-posts

# Generate graph for last 36 months only
just graph-posts-36
```

### Direct execution

```bash
# Count posts
go run post-counter.go

# Generate graph (all months)
go run graph-generator.go blog-monthly-20251207.csv

# Generate graph for last 36 months
go run graph-generator.go blog-monthly-20251207.csv 36
```

## What It Does

### Post Counter (`post-counter.go`)

The post counter:

1. Fetches the blog posts page from `https://www.chicks.net/posts/`
2. Follows pagination links to gather all posts across multiple pages
3. Parses post dates using regex pattern matching
4. Groups posts by month (YYYY-MM format)
5. Writes results to CSV file named `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD.csv`
6. Displays count of posts per month in chronological order

### Graph Generator (`graph-generator.go`)

The graph generator:

1. Reads the CSV file generated by the post counter
2. Fills in missing months with zero counts to show gaps
3. Optionally limits the graph to the last N months
4. Generates an animated SVG graph with:
   - Line chart showing post count trends
   - Grid lines for readability
   - Axis labels (months on X-axis, post count on Y-axis)
   - GitHub-style color scheme
   - Smooth animation effects
5. Outputs SVG file with naming pattern:
   - All months: `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD-graph.svg`
   - Limited months: `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD-graph-N.svg` (where N is the number of months)

## Output Format

### Console Output

```text
Posts per Month:
================
2025-05: 1
2025-06: 2
2025-08: 1
================
Total Posts: 10

Results written to: blog-monthly-20251207.csv
```

### CSV Output

The program creates a CSV file with the naming pattern `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD.csv`
where YYYYMMDD is today's date. The CSV contains:

- Header row: `Month,Count`
- Data rows: Month in YYYY-MM format, post count for that month
- Sorted chronologically by month

### SVG Output

The graph generator creates an SVG file that can be:

- Viewed in any web browser
- Embedded in GitHub READMEs or web pages
- Opened in vector graphics editors

**Filename patterns:**

- `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD-graph.svg` - Graph of all months
- `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD-graph-36.svg` - Graph of last 36 months
- `blog-monthly-YYYYMMDD-graph-12.svg` - Graph of last 12 months

**Features:**

- Responsive SVG that scales to any size
- Animated line drawing effect on load
- GitHub-style color scheme (#26a641 for the line)
- Automatic Y-axis scaling based on max post count
- X-axis labels showing dates in "MMM 'YY" format
- Missing months filled with zero to show activity gaps

**Examples:**

All months:

![Blog posts per month - all time](blog-monthly-20251207-graph.svg)

Last 36 months:

![Blog posts per month - last 36 months](blog-monthly-20251207-graph-36.svg)

## Implementation Details

### Post Counter

- Uses standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Parses dates in format: "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "November 20, 2025")
- Automatically handles pagination by following "Next »" links
- Tracks visited URLs to avoid infinite loops
- Outputs results sorted chronologically by month

### Graph Generator

- Uses standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Fills in missing months between min and max dates
- Supports optional month limit argument
- Generates SVG with inline CSS styling
- Uses Chartist.js-inspired styling and animations
- Automatically scales chart based on data range
