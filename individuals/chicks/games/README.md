Analysis of games I'm playing or have played.  I've often been heard to say:

> You are not serious about a game until you have built a spreadsheet for it.

This directory is a small effort to demonstrate what I mean.  I'm starting
with one game, but I will eventually export some of my other spreadsheets
in here to show that I've been doing this sort of thing for **decades**.
