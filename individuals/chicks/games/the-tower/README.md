# The Tower

This is a game that baffles everyone who sees me playing it. I'm sure they'd
be even more baffled to discover I've been tracking my matches to discern any
signs of progress. I was able to gain some insights from this spreadsheet
itself, but I knew I wanted to eventually generate some scatter plots and
trend lines. Here it is.
