The vineyards are lovely.\n\nThere are so many birds: hawks, finches, bluebirds, robins, wrens, and starlings.  You will hear them and see them: so great.\n\nThe manor house is extremely nice.  It reminds me of the nicest beds and breakfasts I've ever visited.  They've done a great job of designing the space and decorating it.  There are a variety of nice bedrooms and and a great kitchen/dining area.\n\nThe barn and event space are spacious.  The kids had a great time running around the expansive lawn.

The bathrooms are convenient and plentiful.\n\nWe are looking forward to finding another reason to do an event at Bella Terra."

It doesn't take much googling to discover that sewer gas is toxic and could explode.  We got a refund, but the manager's lack of concern for a toxic situation doesn't leave me wanting to ever give them money again.  Closing the theaters that have this odor until this problem is resolved would seem to be the responsible thing.  I wasn't the only one that smelled it.  Two other people were expressing similar concerns, but the manager didn't care."
