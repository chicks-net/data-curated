# Duolingo characters

From the perspective of someone learning Spanish from English.

- [The data](characters.toml) is in [TOML format](https://toml.io/en/).
- The [character reference](character_reference.md) is built by [this script](build-character.sh) from the TOML.

## Ideas

- import into sqlite
- view through datasette
- keep filling out more metadata

[the duolingo fandom](https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Main_Characters).
It is too bad this is hosted at fandom.
