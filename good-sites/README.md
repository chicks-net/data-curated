# Good sites

Some links to places that I think could be handy.

## Lists

* [Top GitHub repositories everyone should look at](https://github.com/sachin-source/top-github-repositories-which-everyone-should-look) has a lot of good stuff in it.

## Creative

### Stock images

### Music

* [mobygratis](https://mobygratis.com/) has some unique limitations, but could be really handy


## Travel

### Weather

* [MerrySky](https://merrysky.net/) is the best visualization of the weather.
* [ansiweather](https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather) is the best command line weather.
