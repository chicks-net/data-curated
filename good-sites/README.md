# Good sites

Some links to places that I think could be handy.

## Lists

- [Top GitHub repositories everyone should look at](https://github.com/sachin-source/top-github-repositories-which-everyone-should-look) has a lot of good stuff in it.

## Creative

### Stock images

### Music

- [mobygratis](https://mobygratis.com/) has some unique limitations, but could be really handy

### Books and Periodicals

- [The Online Books Page](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/) lists free
  books and periodicals available online.  So far they've already had every
  collective that I've come across.
- [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/) has books online from a variety of
  government agencies and academic institutions such as the University of
  Michigan, Cornell, and UCSF.

## Travel

### Weather

- [MerrySky](https://merrysky.net/) is the best visualization of the weather.
- [ansiweather](https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather) is the best command line weather.

## Games

- [The Tower Knowledge Hub](https://the-tower.notion.site/) provides a great example
  of what is possible for a game information site.  In the era of Fandom sites
  overloaded with ads it is a breath of fresh air for any site on any topic to
  just have information, nice formatted.  Particulalry if you're familiar with
  Notion you will enjoy seeing all of the nice databases and lovely multi-column layouts.
